# QuestWatcher

QuestWatcher is a World of Warcraft AddOn that will automatically track/watch quests as you change areas.

For example: if you're in Elwynn Forest and then go into Stormwind City, QuestWatcher will automatically stop watching quests from Elwynn Forest and starting watching quests in Stormwind City.

QuestWatcher will also inform you about how many completed quests you have in area.
